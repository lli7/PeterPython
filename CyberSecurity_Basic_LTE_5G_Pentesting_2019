This is just a begaining 5G system security analysis and will be update period.

5G system is complete IP based end-to-end network architecture.
It key feature and network capabilities is such as latency, data rate, mobility, reliability, security.

Security attack method: Distributed denial of service(DDoS) and Advance persistent threat(APT)

1. UE security
   Smartphone(iOS, Androind security )
   IoT (Linux, FreeRTOS security. Authentication, authorization, shared information etc)
2. Core Network security
   EPS(eNB, MME, S-GW, P-GW, HSS)
   5GC(gNB, ng-eNB, AMF, UPF)
   5G core network will based on Hypervisor, SDN, NFV later then will expose security threat.
   NAS attack point:
   attach, detach, bearer activation, location update, authentication procedures.

Device security threat:
inconsistent security policies when deployment kinds of devices.
information or data leakage in shared media.
minimal device management such as IoT field.
save the readable data in disposed devices such as save data on external SD card.
inter-application data leakage such as authorization by third party aplication or save data with cloud network.
