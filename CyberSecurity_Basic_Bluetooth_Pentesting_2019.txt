
Bluetooth basic security concept and pentesting tools

Device type:
Silent: The device will never accept any connections, It just monitors BT traffic.
Private: The device cannot be discovered.But Connection will be accepted only if the Master know it's BD_ADDR.
Public: The device can be both discovered and connected to.

class 1 transmit powers  100mW (20 dBm)
class 2 transmit powers  2.5mW(4 dBm)
class 3 transmit powers  1 mW(0 dBm)

security mode:
None: The Bluetooth device does not include securre option.
Service Level: Two Bluetooth devices can establish a nonsecure ACL link.
Link Level:  Secure initiated when an ACL link is established.

Authentication is used for proving the identity of one piconet device to another.
Access type can be granted according the authentication result.
Bluetooth authenticates devices, not user.

Before EDR2.0, just use same unit key to all device, kinds of issue here.
SSP introduce the public key to improve the security.

Disclosure threat means that information can leak from the target system to an eavesdropper.
Integrity threat concerns the deliberate alteration of information in an attempt to mislead the recipient.
DoS threat involves blocking access to a service, either making it unavailable etc.

Scaning:
hciconfig hci0 up
hcitool scan
hcitool inq
sdptool browse <MAC>
l2ping  <MAC>
